title: My Experience With A MLM Company

I’m sure some of you may be wondering, what’s MLM? I’ll delve into that later. First, here is some context:

It’s my Semester Break now, and I decided to look for a part-time job. I downloaded the Jobs DB app, and I came across this advert posted on GumTree.

I thought to myself, “Oh, it looks like a typical admin job and the hours are quite flexible. The pay is quite high, not bad”.

Thus, I texted the Tyler person with the number posted on the advert. We agreed that I would go down to his office near Bendemeer/Lavender for an interview.

When I saw that the interview might take 1 to 1.5h, I was dumbfounded. However, I didn’t think much of it.
Then came Friday. I reached the place at 12.45 pm, and Tyler told me to contact Michelle, his manager. I did so, and Michelle told me to take a seat at the nearby coffee shop as I was too early. I was already feeling very sceptical, and I thought that maybe this was some elaborate prank.

After waiting till 1.11 pm, Michelle finally informed me that I could make my up to their office. She told me to look for Evan, who was one of the managers.

I instantaneously thought, “Then what was the point in contacting Michelle?”

Nonetheless, I still went up as I thought that maybe this was a proper job interview. When I stepped in, the company’s name, B** G****, was displayed on the wall.

> The company name has been censored as I do not want to get sued.

I was greeted by a man dressed neatly in a suit. Of course, his name was Evan. Evan started by showing me two certificates that was neatly framed on the wall. One of the certificates showed that the company had received a Singapore SME 500 award.

These were the 2 certificates. I found it displayed on their website and took a screenshot.

There was also a coffee machine looking device that was displayed along with the certificates. Evan said that this was one of the products that his company sells, an alkaline water filtration system.

Evan then led me to a table, and we sat down. I looked around their office, and it seemed very bare. It was pretty dark and poorly lit. There were many tables and chairs placed around the entire space. It did not look like a typical office at all. He informed me that his manager, Jia Hui, would be coming shortly to talk to me.

I was pretty amused, and I knew something was up. Just how many mangers were there in this company? They have an extensive hierarchy system in place.

Evan excused himself after 5 minutes to check if Jia Hui was coming. I quickly googled the company, and I saw “B** G**** MLM” in the autocomplete search results. At that moment, I knew that I had just wasted my time coming here.

I have a terrible impression of Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) companies. I have the perception that they are dishonest companies with appalling ethics.

I did think of leaving, but I did not know how I should phrase it. I am rather non-confrontational in real-life. I was also quite curious about what they had to say. Thus, I stayed.

Another girl joined me at the table. Let’s just call her Kim.

Eventually, Jia Hui came. She was a poly graduate that started working full time at the company after she graduated.

She started sharing animatedly about their organisational structure. While doing so, she was scribbling away on a piece of paper.

I secretly took a picture after Jia Hui left us alone for a while.
The general gist was that you would be paired with a “senior”. The commission made from a successful sale would then be split between the two of you. You will be promoted to the next level when you close a specified number of sales. As you progress, naturally your commission percentage would become higher too.

They also have a team system in place. The team can consist of several juniors and seniors. If your team makes a lot of money, the company will reward the team with extra cash. The juniors would get a bigger split than the seniors. They employ this as their selling point when they try to recruit new people.

Halfway through the “interview”, Jia Hui paused to ask how Kim and I felt. Were we scared that we couldn’t close sales? Were we confident? Were we excited to earn a lot of money?

She waited and expected a response from both of us. Kim said that she was scared she couldn’t close sales. When it came to my turn, I told her that I felt very apprehensive about this whole thing. I told her that I suspected this to be an MLM scheme.

Jia Hui said yes that their company employs an MLM system. However, she was quick to emphasise that what they are doing is legal. She told me that there are three types of MLM schemes:

⋅⋅* DIRECT SELLING
⋅⋅* PYRAMID
⋅⋅* PONZI

She said that their company employs a direct selling approach and that it is perfectly legal in Singapore. As for the other two, they are illegal. After doing more research in my own time, I found that she was right.

Here is an article for your perusal if you want to know more Pyramid and Ponzi schemes.

> This picture is linked to the website, click [here](https://dsas.org.sg/ "Direct Selling Association of Singapore") if you want to explore it too.

I came across this website while I was researching more about Direct-Selling. There is a Direct Selling Association in Singapore. However, B** G**** was not listed inside.

After doing more investigating, I found out that it is not a requirement for companies to register themselves with the association. It operates via a membership system, and companies can apply to be part of the association. The association is not regulated by the authorities. Just how legitimate is the whole direct selling scene in Singapore?

Back to the topic, Jia Hui tried to reassure me by saying what her company is doing is perfectly legal. She also emphasised that they are on the same tier as real estate and insurance agents. Jia Hui asked if I had any questions and I said no.

She told Kim and I that we had to attend 1-2 more training sessions. She was quick to ask whether we would be free the next day. When Kim and I said no, she kept suggesting other dates. In my opinion, it was very desperate. I was not happy with how she kept pushing us to attend the sessions. To get her to back off, I told her that I would get back to her.

Jia Hui left us, and another man named Danny came to talk to us. Danny started off the conversation by making small talk. Subsequently, he delved into a personal anecdote of how he was scammed into an MLM scheme when he was still a Poly student.

Danny told us that he too was sceptical of B** G**** in the beginning. However, he claimed that he just went for the training sessions and managed to close some deals. He found it okay and continued with it till today.

A screen grab of Danny on B** G****’s Instagram account.
B** G**** only sells two health products — an alkaline water filtration system and a mattress insert that has a lot of “magnets” inside them.

Danny claimed that his father’s health had drastically improved after using the mattress. He even showed Kim and me a picture of his father’s health report/test.

Danny could sense that I was uninterested in what he was saying as I kept shifting around in my seat. He asked me if I was okay, and I said yes. He quickly ended the chat and told us to confirm our next training session soon.

I remember being so relieved that the whole ordeal was finally over! Kim was also very relieved, as she also felt that this entire thing was a scam.

The main qualm I have with the company is this: If your products are so good, do you even need to employ a Direct Selling strategy? You can sell it commercially in stores and let customers try the mattress out for themselves. If just switching to a different mattress can solve everybody’s health problems, do we still need doctors?

Jia Hui told me that their clientele is mostly elderly people. I was irked when I heard this as the elderly are not well-educated. They fall prey to scams and gimmicks more easily. Who knows how many vulnerable elderly people have they sold their wonder products to so far?

Furthermore, these products are not cheap as the prices have been marked up considerably to cover the commission fees. Most of the money forked out by these elderly must have come from their retirement nest egg.

While doing my own investigation about B** G****, I came across posts about people complaining about the training sessions. They said that the “seniors” training them forced them to call their friends and family on the spot to try to sell the products to them.

This is very despicable of them. Not only do they want to scam the vulnerable elderly, but they are also willing to scam their own loved ones.

This is my friend’s account of them forcing her to call her relatives on the spot. Unfortunately, she also thought it was just a simple job interview like me.

After I went home, I was still fuming with rage. Michelle texted me to ask me how was the briefing. (Quick recap, she was the one who told me to go up to the office to meet Evan. She was not present).

I told her how I felt and how they could be more upfront with their business when recruiting people. Surprisingly, she was very polite about it. She was receptive to what I said and thanked me too.

Michelle was not even aware of the existence of these advertisements. Based on this, I conclude that these adverts must have been posted by lone agents who wanted to recruit more people to join their team.

Their company is very unstructured. But I guess that’s just MLM for you.

In conclusion, I understand why people are attracted to this business model. It is very lucrative and you can make a lot of money in a short period of time. However, I dislike how they target the unwitting elderly.
