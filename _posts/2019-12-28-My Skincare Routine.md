Hey guys! Welcome back to another blog post. ☺️

Today I’ll be sharing my skincare routine, as well as some tips to prevent pimple outbreaks. Since young, I’ve had generally clear skin. My skin condition can be described as sensitive/normal. I hope these tips would be helpful!

***CLEANSING:*** I wash my face twice a day with Cetaphil’s Gentle Skin Cleanser. It is great as it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin!

***EXFOLIATION:*** I use a Konjac sponge from Innisfree/Daiso! It gently exfoliates without irritating my skin. I’ll apply some of my cleanser and rub the sponge around my face and neck.

I also use APRILSKIN’s Real Calendula Peel Off Pack. After using it, whatever pimples I have become less red! It soothes and calms my skin. It removes dead skin cells when I peel off the mask. 

***TONER:\*** I use Bio Essence’s Bio-Water Moist-in Water Lotion. I bought it because it’s suitable for my sensitive skin! It is free from fragrance, alcohol, mineral oil and colourants. 

***MOISTURISER:\*** I use APRILSKIN’s Real Calendula Deep Moisture Essence. I really love the Calendula series! Both the peel off mask gel and this moisturiser contains real calendula flowers! 

***MIST:\*** I use Bio Essence’s Bio-Water Energising Water. I spray it whenever I’m too lazy to apply my toner and moisturiser. 

I also use Laneige’s Water Bank Moisture Mist. It moisturises my face although it does leave my skin feeling sticky.  

***BLACKHEADS AND WHITEHEADS:\*** When my nose feels clogged, I take a comedones stick remover to squeeze out all the sebaceous filaments, blackheads and whiteheads. Before that, I’ll use a warm towel to open up my pores by holding it there for about a minute. It makes extraction easier! 

When I’m too lazy, I’ll use a Biore Pore Strip. It works too! 

***SUNSCREEN:\*** I use Innisfree’s Blueberry Rebalancing Watery Sun Cream. It has an SPF of 45 PA+++. I bought it in Korea! I don’t think it’s sold in Singapore. I love it because it doesn’t leave a white sheen on my face. The formula isn’t too thick too, so my skin doesn’t feel sticky afterwards. 

***PIMPLES:*** Whenever a pimple pops up, I use Sebamed’s anti-pimple gel. It’s slightly expensive but it works.

**SOME TIPS:**

1. Change your towel once every week! Don’t ever use your towel to wipe your face, even after showering. For me, I just avoid wiping my face and let my face dry by itself. If you want, you could use dry tissues! Your towel would absorb your hair’s oil. It isn’t nice to rub on all those excess oil on your face.
2. Change your pillowcase regularly! It isn’t nice to rub all those excess oil from your hair on your face. Same logic as point number one.
3. When my face feels oily, I’ll use blotting paper to remove all those excess oil. We all know excess oil would lead to a pimple outbreak! Make sure to not use it too often, as your skin would take it as it’s not producing enough oil. As a result, your will produce EVEN MORE oil.
4. If you have bangs, it’s better to pin up your bangs or regularly wipe your sweat and oil off your forehead.
