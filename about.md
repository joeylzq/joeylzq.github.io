Hello, my name is Joey. I’m currently a Year 3 Mass Communications student at The School of Film and Media Studies, Ngee Ann Polytechnic.​

In my free time, I like to read and write. I would like to become a Journalist in the future. I’m inspired by the likes of CNA Insider and Humans of New York. I would love to tell stories of normal, everyday people.
